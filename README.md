I use next.js to create a calculator app
peer reviewer: Avery Hillstrom
peer review: Functionality is good, the totals populate after you select the tip %, the reset button works and resets all displayed values, and despite the type number inputs being a little weird it does work as intended. The styling is pretty close to the original, but the spacing between tip and total sections is too large and pushes the total to the bottom of the div and the reset button completely out of the dark cyan section. Styling, logic, and overall design are very close to the original vision, it just needs a little tweaking and it's good to go!
